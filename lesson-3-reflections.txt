When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You would want to us a remote repository when you are sharing code to work on
with others, working from multiple computers, you have your work on a
development or production server, or you want to have a backup of the code that
you are working on.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with others, you would want to make sure that the work
they have done is acceptable, doesn't create conflicts, etc.
