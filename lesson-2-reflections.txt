What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you init the git repository, a hidden folder(.git) is created where all of
the metadata regarding changes will be stored.  It needs to be done so that git
will have a place for all of its information.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository.  It allows you to keep your working directory separated from your commits so that you can apply commits in logical fashion.
